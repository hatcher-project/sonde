Sonde
=====

WIP

Sonde is a framework-independent php debug bar.

It was inspired by [php-debugbar](https://github.com/maximebf/php-debugbar) but it is more simple and more lightweight.
The reason this project was born is because php debugbar is very heavy on the frontend (lot of dependancy, including 
jquery). In my opinion it's a problem and sonde solves this problem by providing a very small browser footprint (only
vanilla javascript).
